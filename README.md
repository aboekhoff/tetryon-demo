## TODO Optimizations
- add/remove entities from system lists whenever mask changes
- enhance dependencies with simple OR and NOT
- leverage ES6 Maps and Sets
- add typed linked lists with object pooling
- add typed vectors with object pooling
- ie, make it so if dev is determined enough zero gc churn
  is possible

## TODO Head in the Clouds
- create sufficiently high level API on top of engine layer that
  it is possible to compile application code to C++ for improved
  performance and deployment to multiple platforms.

  prototype game in web browser, then 1-click performance boost
  and deployment to desktop, iOS, and Android
